{{- if not .Values.ingress.enabled }}
NanoMon has been deployed, but no ingress was configured. To get the IP addresses run this command:
kubectl get svc {{ include "nanomon.fullname" . }}-api {{ include "nanomon.fullname" . }}-frontend

NOTE: Additional configuration e.g. frontend.apiEndpoint will most likely be required
{{- else }}
{{- if and .Values.ingress.host }}
NanoMon frontend is accessible at {{ $scheme }}://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}/
{{- else }}
No host was provided for the ingress, this is generally a pretty bad idea :)
But you can use the external IP of your ingress controller to access the app

Run these two commands:
INGRESS_IP=$(kubectl get ingress {{ include "nanomon.fullname" . }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
echo -e "\n\nNanoMon frontend is accessible at {{ $scheme }}://$INGRESS_IP/\n\n"
{{- end }}
{{- end }}

{{- if .Values.postgresql.primary.persistence.enabled }}

You have enabled persistent storage for Postgres, it will take several minutes before the application is fully available 
{{- if not .Values.postgresql.auth.password }}
WARNING: You have enabled persistence but not set `postgresql.auth.password` this is a bad idea 
See the docs for details.
